          <p>This website is realised by me "Mahdi Hadiji" as a study project in the Faculty of Economics and Management of Sfax  </p>
          <p> As a student in the "management computing" , besides learning the basics of management and economics science, I am discovring the computer science field which was very interesting for me. </p>
          <p>Thanks to my study program I am now able to develop small programs and algorithms for small applications.</p>
          <p> Also, my studies gave me the opportunity to dig more into web developement and work with "HTML" and "CSS" which are the basics of web developement that every web developer must know how to work with.</p>
          <p> This project was a reason to learn more and practice the theoric knowledge learned in class.  </p>
          <p> I hope you liked my project and enjoyed surfing into its pages !   </p>
          <p> Thanks !   </p>
